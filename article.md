Introduction
------------

[the lingua franca of quorum sensing]
Quorum sensing is the ability of bacteria to sense their own concentration.
When in small numbers, quorum sensing receptors are not activated, but when
a critical threshold is achieved, these receptors cause production of
"public goods" that are only beneficial when produced in unison.
In gram positive bacteria, evolutionary close species
[what's evolutionary close? check avigdor's references] exhibit
high diversity of their quorum sensing machinery. A proprosed model
that explains how such diversity forms introduces an evolutionary ratchet
in which the order of divergence in QS signal or receptor matters.
