In Avigdor's article:

This divergence seems to be under strong selection, as implied by the functional divergence and is also corroborated by rapid sequence divergence [8][] [9][], the signatures of diversifying selection [10][] [11][], and the spread of divergent QS systems through horizontal gene transfer [3][] [12][].
